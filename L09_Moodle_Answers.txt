Task 1a.1: Output of the network for x₁=1 and x₂=1
Answer: 6

Task 1a.2: Output of the network for x₁=1 and x₂=-1
Answer: 0

Task 2a: Forward pass implementation
def forward_pass(x, W, u):
    hidden_outputs = activation(x.T @ W)
    y = activation(u @ hidden_outputs)
    return y

Task 2b: Weight updates in stochastic gradient descent
W = W - learning_rate * grad_w
u = u - learning_rate * grad_u

Task 3a: Option with biggest impact on model performance
- Adding bias terms (use_bias=True)
- Using 'adam' optimizer
- Increasing hidden nodes

Final accuracy achieved: 1.0 (100%)
